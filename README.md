## Introduction
Education is important for achieving economic and social progress, enhancing people's lives, and rising income. Also, it increases people's productivity while also boosting business and technological growth. Most countries are now on the point of expanding access to various school levels, as well as taking the initiative to resolve difficulties in education at all levels. No country can achieve economic growth without a substantial investment in human capital.

However, one of the reasons for the alter within the returns pattern is the race between innovation and education, as labor markets alter to computerization. In this modern world, the capacity of laborers to compete is crippled by the destitute execution of education systems in most creating nations. Innovative change and worldwide competition request the dominance of competencies and the procurement of new skills for many. Due to COVID-19, education issues in the Philippines have increased and received new challenges that worsened the current state of the country. Further, a blended learning program was launched in October 2020, which involves online classes, printouts, and lessons broadcast on TV and social platforms. Thus, the new learning pathways rely on students and teachers having access to the internet ([Childhope Ph, 2021](https://childhope.org.ph/education-issues-in-the-philippines/#)).

Countries got to make strides in quality, endeavor for brilliance, and extend openings, based on productivity and value. This means ensuring that distraught youth select and succeed. Quality education is really one of the foremost effective instruments for lessening destitution and imbalance and it sets the establishment for supported economic development. It tends to raise efficiency and inventiveness, as well as fortify business and innovative breakthroughs. All of these variables lead to more prominent yield and economic growth.

## Problem Statement

The problems that this study will address are the increasing unemployment rate and the global GDP loss, which both have an impact on people's lives. Furthermore, the lack of quality education among many people leads to a slowing of economic growth. COVID-19 threatened the health of individuals and communities and damaged the global economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global recession will be as bad as or worse than the recession encountered in 2009. Also, according to International Labor Organization (ILO), when unemployment rises, more than half of the world's workforce is at risk of losing their jobs. The problem is based on the increasing number of students who are not going to school. As shown in a UNESCO research conducted in April 2020, around 1.6 billion children and young people were not enrolled in school. Also, over 369 million children who depend on school food should find different sources of nourishment on a regular basis.

With regards to the problem, findings suggest that increased unemployment among highly educated employees might have a good or negative impact on economic growth, necessitating the implementation of appropriate policies to mitigate the negative impact. ([Maneejuk, 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/2/520)). Every student's poor level and lack of education has a major influence on our economy's slowdown, as well as the rising rates of unemployment affecting our economy at risk that needs to be addressed.


## Significance of the proposed project


This proposed project will help society because the improvement of an excellent education is a vital part of our economy today. Our economy will be more effective if there is a higher demand for graduates with a background in quality education. Given that context, the proposed topic will motivate a large number of people to contribute to economic progress by providing them with good knowledge for the future.

This study will be beneficial to:

__The Students__

The students will be the immediate recipients of the proposed topic's production. Improvements in the quality of their education will provide them with a greater opportunity to gain more information and experience with the topics they will likely meet in the future. This study will also be beneficial to students because it will act as a guide for conducting research.

__The Teachers__

Since the proposed project is an enhancement of the quality of education, teachers will receive more new knowledge for the improvements of the lessons they share with the students. It will also serve to increase the experience of teachers. In addition, the findings of the study can be used by teachers who teach classes about education and economic growth.

__The Economy__

Economic growth will be achieved on this proposed topic. Having good graduates that have a background of the enhancement of the quality of education will produce a student that is more equipped in the field and it will give much more productive work that will somehow help our economy rise up and this also could be the start to have a rich economy.


## Methods

The exploratory analysis (EDA) method will be used for Quality Education Enhancement Lead for Economic Growth. This research identifies the role of education in contributing to economic growth, with a specific focus on the quality of education. It shows that population cognitive skills, rather than simply school accomplishment, were highly related to individual salaries, income distribution, and economic growth. New research findings emphasize the importance of basic and advanced skills, as well as the complementarity of skills and the quality of institutions, and the strength of the skills-growth relationship. The differences between countries that include more data on cognitive skills reveal substantially bigger skill deficits in poor nations than would be expected based on school enrolment and completion alone. Because of the degree of change required, narrowing the economic gap with industrialized countries will be necessary.


## Expected output 
The study plans to do an exploratory data analysis of education and economic growth conditions in many countries over the past years. The data sets from UN data will be used in this project to gather all of the data needed. The data sets will help to assess each country's education and income ratios. The data that researchers collect is conducted to evaluate the rates of various countries in order to manage education-enhancing, for effective economic growth. Data collected shows that with each higher degree of educational attainment, citizens have better employment rates. Individuals with higher degrees of education gain more benefits and it is easier for them to find work, learn new skills and have more experiences, and make more money while working than those with lower levels of education. Analyzing the methods of successful countries will provide the way for the economy to grow.
